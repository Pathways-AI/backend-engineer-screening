# Pathways Backend Debugging Screening Challenge

This challenge involves fixing bugs in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculator. The code is _supposed_ to calculate the environmental impact of a production process based on the recipe to produce the product (in this case, a plastic water bottle), but contains several bugs that prevent it from running correctly.

This screening challenge is a quick sense check of your ability to understand and debug code that is new to you and is meant to take <30 minutes (or likely, under 15). While you are free to add, change, and remove code as you see fit, **NO NEW FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED!**

That said, the code certainly doesn't work as intended/described; all comments and docstrings accurately describe intentions of the code. While the primary objective is to resolve the existing issues and get the correct answer, you should also treat this like this is your own code going into a production environment - feel free to change it to match your style, optimize, etc.!

_I promise the code we write day to day is so much better than this_

# To Run

Any standard python install will work, just run `python challenge.py` to run the code and (eventually) get some output!

# What To Submit

Once you have fixed all bugs/errors, please submit the following in the Google Form:

- The total Global Warming Potential printed out
- Your code

# What you'll be judged on

1. The correct answer (this is a binary pass/fail)
2. How you went about fixing the bugs
3. Your styling/coding choices
